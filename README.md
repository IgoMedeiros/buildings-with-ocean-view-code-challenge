# **Buildings with an Ocean View**

This solution identifies which buildings in a given array have a view of the ocean. A building has a view of the ocean if:
- It is taller than all buildings to its right.

The algorithm processes the buildings from right to left, efficiently tracking the tallest building encountered so far. This ensures that each building is only evaluated once.

---

## **Algorithm**

### **Steps**
1. **Input**: An array of building heights where each element represents the height of a building. The array is processed from the rightmost building (closest to the ocean) to the leftmost building.
2. **Track the tallest building**:
   - Maintain a variable `hightestBuilding` to store the maximum height encountered so far.
   - Compare the current building's height (`currentBuildingHeight`) to `hightestBuilding`.
3. **Add buildings with a view**:
   - If the current building is taller than `hightestBuilding`, it has a view of the ocean, so its position (index) is added to the result.
   - Update `hightestBuilding` with the current building's height.
4. **Output**:
   - The function returns an array of positions (indices) for all buildings with an ocean view.

---

## **Variables**
- `hightestBuilding`: Tracks the tallest building encountered so far while iterating.
- `buildingPosition`: Tracks the current building index being evaluated.
- `buildingsPosition`: Stores the positions (indices) of buildings with a view to the ocean.

---

## **Time and Space Complexity**
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the array once from right to left.
   - Complexity: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of buildings.
2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The output array (`buildingsPosition`) stores indices of buildings with a view.
   - Complexity: \( O(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of buildings with an ocean view. In the worst case, all buildings have an ocean view, so \( O(k) = O(n) \).

---

## **Code Explanation**

```javascript
const getBuildingsPositionWithViewToTheOcean = (buildings) => {
    let hightestBuilding = 0; // Tracks the tallest building encountered so far.
    let buildingPosition = buildings.length - 1; // Start at the rightmost building.
    const buildingsPosition = []; // Stores indices of buildings with a view.

    // Process buildings from right to left
    while (buildingPosition >= 0) {
        const currentBuildingHeight = buildings[buildingPosition]; // Current building height

        // If the current building is taller than the tallest seen so far, it has a view
        if (currentBuildingHeight > hightestBuilding) {
            hightestBuilding = currentBuildingHeight; // Update the tallest building
            buildingsPosition.unshift(buildingPosition); // Add this building's index to the result
        }

        buildingPosition--; // Move to the next building to the left
    }

    return buildingsPosition; // Return indices of buildings with a view
};

// Example Input
const buildings = [6, 7, 3, 4, 2];

// Example Output
console.log('###### SOLUTION ######');
console.log(`Hightests buildings position with view to the ocean: ${getBuildingsPositionWithViewToTheOcean(buildings)}`);
```

## **Test Case**

### **Input**
```javascript
const buildings = [6, 7, 3, 4, 2];
```

### **Output**
```javascript
Hightests buildings position with view to the ocean: [1, 3, 4]
```

### **Explanation**
1. Start at the rightmost building:
   - **Index 4 (Height 2)**: Tallest so far → Add to result → `hightestBuilding = 2`.
2. Move to **Index 3 (Height 4)**:
   - Taller than `hightestBuilding = 2` → Add to result → `hightestBuilding = 4`.
3. Move to **Index 2 (Height 3)**:
   - Shorter than `hightestBuilding = 4` → Skip.
4. Move to **Index 1 (Height 7)**:
   - Taller than `hightestBuilding = 4` → Add to result → `hightestBuilding = 7`.
5. Move to **Index 0 (Height 6)**:
   - Shorter than `hightestBuilding = 7` → Skip.

Final result: `[1, 3, 4]`.

## **Key Insights**
- The algorithm is efficient and processes each building once.
- Using `unshift` ensures the order of buildings in the result matches their order in the original array.
